- Do you trust / understand the methodology of the data collection? (particularly if you are working with data collected by others)
- Do you know who collected the data?
- Do you know how they collected it and what assumptions they were making?
- Are you an expert in the subject matter or do you need help with verification?
- Are the subjects of the data research inputting into verification?
- What process will you use to make decisions around deidentification/anonymization of data sets? Should you work in resources to engage with eternal experts?

##What next:

- *Develop a plan of action for verifying and cleaning*
