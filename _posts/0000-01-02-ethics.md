title:  "Ethics"
---

- What are your organization’s ethics, principles, and values, which will be important to this project?
- How do you align your organisational policies to this project? Do you need to update them to ensure they helpfully apply to your data driven project? For example, how will you address privacy, consent?
- Who could potentially be adversely affected by data use in your project, and how?
- What would happen if the project would need to be stopped? How would you deal with the data and with communication with the data subjects. Who is responsible for ‘pressing stop’ on these projects.
- Who in the project/organisation will have oversight and accountability for use of this data use?

##What next:

- Develop an ethics/responsibility plan for the project and a monitoring plan for assuring compliance.
- Develop a data security plan and "Red Buttons" checklist for dealing with breaches, including circumstances for suspending/ending program.
